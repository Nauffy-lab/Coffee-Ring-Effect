# Coffee-Ring-Effect
As part of a Summer Research Project under Prof. Guruswamy Kumaraswamy at the Chemical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay, we investigated the evaporation dynamics of sessile droplets to understand interfacial transport phenomena. We successfully reproduced literature results for velocity fields and streamlines within an evaporating droplet on flat surfaces, validating the accuracy and consistency of established findings. Additionally, we developed a computational model to simulate the behavior of a water droplet on a shallow oil layer, integrating interfacial dynamics, evaporation processes, and fluid interactions to analyze the underlying physical mechanisms. To further enhance the study, we implemented a numerical method and MATLAB code to compute velocity profiles within the evaporating droplet, ensuring precise and efficient analysis of flow behavior in complex multi-phase systems.
